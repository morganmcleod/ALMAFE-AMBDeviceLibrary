'''
AMBConnectionItf represents a connection to a CAN bus.
This interface class declares what the various concrete AmbConnnection* classes must do.
It can be a local direct CAN connection or a bus provided by a SocketServer.
Typically you will create only one AMBConection and share it among one or more AMBDevices.
Implements bare CAN bus monitor, control, and node search.
